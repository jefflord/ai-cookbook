# Copilot Instructions

This repository uses an AI assistant to help with code authoring.

## Scope
- Focus on implementing requested features, bug fixes, documentation, and tests.
- Keep changes minimal and targeted; avoid large-scale refactors unless explicitly requested.

## Git Operations
Do **not** run git add / commit / push / branch operations. A human will handle version control tasks. Simply make the necessary file edits; staging and committing are not required.

## Style & Conventions
- Preserve existing code style and formatting.
- Prefer small, incremental changes.
- Update or add concise docstrings and comments when introducing new logic.

## Security & Privacy
- Do not introduce secrets or credentials.
- Avoid sending repository code or large excerpts externally.

## When Unsure
- If requirements are ambiguous, implement a reasonable minimal version and clearly note assumptions at the top of your response.
